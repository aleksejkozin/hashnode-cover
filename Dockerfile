# JS is super powerful. You can do with it everything: front, back, even deploy infrastructure
# You can easily install dependencies with npm/yarn, even platform native dependencies
# However, sometimes node_modules is not enough
#
# Sometimes you need Docker. You need Docker only when:
# - Your background tasks take more than 4 minutes to complete
# - You have some dependency that couldn't be installed with npm/yarn
#   JS ecosystem is so powerful that you can even install native dependencies with npm
#   Sadly, sometimes it's not the case, and you need install something inside your OS manually
#
# If all your dependencies live inside package.json then don't use Docker. Use Vercel/Netlify cloud:
# - Use Vercel/Netlify cloud to deploy your Next.js app. They use Docker under the hood, but they abstract away the details
# - Background tasks/cron could be emulated with periodic ping of routes with https://www.easycron.com/ or github actions
# - You will also need to configure certificate for "az login" to have access to other infrastructure
#
# The differenece between using only Vercel vs deploying Docker with Pulumi to Azure is a x10 difficulty spike
# Double check that you need this spike
#
# Why Docker is a hassle:
# - Slow build. Especially slow when you update package.json
# - Slow deploy. You need to send these >2GB over the wire
# - You need to learn Docker
# - You will need to learn how to work on a low level of an OS
# - Vercel/Netlify provides edge computing that is like global CND for NextJs. There is no edge with your Docker
#
# Ideally, you deploy NextJs to Vercel/Netlify and background workers in a Docker to Azure/DigitalOcean/AWS cloud
# However, it is a hassle, cuz you'll need several accounts
#
# I'll assume that we need Docker for a native dependency and we have only have an Azure account.
# Just for an exercise, cuz I need Docker/Azure in my work.
#
# Rules of Docker thumb:
# - You want your Docker builds to be fast, thus you need to cache dependencies in intermidiate layers
# - You want to keep your container smaller. Otherwise your deployment will be slow
# - You may be tempted to use Docker for local development, but you shouldn't
#   You will not be able to attach debugger and run test from IDE
#   You will also get conflicts with node_modules if you mount your local project folder to the container
#   The conflict: your os is deffirent form container's os
#   This can be resolved by moving container /monorepo/node_modules to /node_modules on docker but this is a hassle
#   Don't develop under Docker, install dependencies locally and run your app
#
# At some point you will run out of space on your disk cuz containers constantly produce waste
# In this case run: "docker system prune -a -f"
#

# We would like to mount yarn cache so we wouldn't need to re download dependencies from the internet
# The mount works only with enabled Buildkite
# Warning, don't mount a cache on node_modules, this will remove them from the container and put into the cache

# Production runner
# Azure cloud will automatically provide a managed identity credentials as MSI env variables
# But you can't just run the container locally, you'll need to do "az login" or provide MSI credentials via env variables
# To do "az login" you need to have the azure cli installed, it's a hassle, we will skip it
# But if you're intereted in the cli, you need to copy /bin/ /lib/ from mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cli

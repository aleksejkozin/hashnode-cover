/*
This is the Base Webpack Configuration.
We will import it in ./packages/* that uses webpack

What webpack does â€“ it joins all the million js/ts files into one file.
All your code is now packed and optimised into a single file.
This is why you can delete node_modules of "devDependencies" from a production docker container.
Some files webpack cannot pack: binaries, assets, images, etc. They will leave around the bundle.js
NextJs uses webpack internally too
